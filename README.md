Are you a senior dev, tired of reviewing and fixing the mess made by these vibe-coded PRs? Or maybe a you're a vibe coder, tired of being told to fix your code? This is the perfect MCP tool for both of you! ü´µ

This MCP server is designed to provide the same perspective as the (grumpy) senior dev of your team. It will review your code, tell you what needs to be fixed and what's wrong with it. All with the sarcastic and cynical tone you've come to expect.

> [!NOTE]
> **What's MCP?**<br>[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/rajyraman/genai-mcp/tree/main#:~:text=MCP%20specification%2C%20defines-,Model%20Context%20Protocol,-MCP%20is%20an) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

## Usage

This tool requires [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to be installed on your system.

### Use with GitHub Copilot

> [!IMPORTANT]
> MCP support in VS Code and GitHub Copilot currently requires the March update of [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) or later. You can install the Insiders version alongside your regular version of VS Code.

You can install the MCP server using the following link:

[![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-VS_Code_Insiders?style=flat-square&label=Install%20MCP%20Server&color=24bfa5)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode-insiders%3Amcp%2Finstall%3F%257B%2522name%2522%253A%2522grumpydev%2522%252C%2522command%2522%253A%2522npx%2522%252C%2522args%2522%253A%255B%2522-y%2522%252C%2522grumpydev-mcp%2540latest%2522%255D%257D)

Or by using the command line:

```bash
code-insiders --add-mcp '{"name":"grumpydev","command":"npx","args":["-y","grumpydev-mcp"]}'
```

Or adding it manually in the `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your workspace:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "grumpydev-mcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "grumpydev-mcp",
      ],
      // Optional, if you want to configure the model
      // "envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env"
    }
  }
}
```

### Use with Claude desktop

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "grumpydev-mcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "grumpydev-mcp",
      ],
      // Optional, if you want to configure the model
      // "env": {
      //   "GENAISCRIPT_DEFAULT_MODEL": "<your_model_config>",
      // }
    }
  }
}
```

## Model configuration

You can configure the model used by this MCP server by setting the `GENAISCRIPT_DEFAULT_MODEL` environment variable. This variable should contain the provider and name of the model you want to use, such as `github:gpt-4o`. By default, it uses [GitHub Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models) with GPT-4o model.

You can use any provider/model supported by [GenAIScript](https://microsoft.github.io/genaiscript/getting-started/configuration/), see the [model configuration](https://microsoft.github.io/genaiscript/getting-started/configuration/) section for more details. Some models may require additional configuration as environment variables, such as API keys or other credentials.
